## Input data description

The following input data are provided to model the head time series. This data were collected from the E-OBS dataset 
v25.0e at 0.1deg grid size.

- Daily Precipitation (RR) in mm/d.
- Daily mean temperature (TG) in degree Celsius.
- Daily minimum temperature (TM) in degree Celsius.
- Daily maximum temperature (TX) in degree Celsius.
- Daily averaged sea level pressure (PP) in hPa.
- Daily averaged relative humidity (HU) in %.
- Daily mean wind speed (FG) in m/s.
- Daily mean global radiation (QQ) in W/m2.
- Potential evaporation (ET) computed with Makkink in mm/d.

## Calibration and testing data

The head data are split into a training and testing period. Data are provided for the training/calibration period. Participants have to provide a simulated time 
series for the entire period:

- **Training period:** 2001-01-01 to 2015-12-31
- **Testing period:** 2016-01-01 to 2021-12-31
