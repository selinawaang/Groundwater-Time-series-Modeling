# Input and Hydraulic Head Data

This folder contains all the data for the groundwater modeling challenge. The data for each location is stored in a 
single folder with that name. Each folder contains: 

- a README.md file that further describes the data and the calibration and validation times.
- a head_data.png showing the 
- a heads.csv file containing the hydraulic head values. The first column is the date (YYYY-MM-DD) and the second
